# TEO Room Planner — Project Context

## What is this?
A web-based room planner for Norsk Gjenvinning (NG) where salespeople can draw waste rooms, place containers, and export a PDF quote for customers.

## Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLite (`app.py`), runs on port 8000
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS — no bundler/framework
- **3D:** Three.js r128 with GLB models from Cloudflare R2
- **Deploy:** Render.com (`python app.py`)

## Coordinate System
- **Canvas 2D:** X right, Y down (standard canvas). Units = meters.
- **Three.js 3D:** canvas X → Three.js X, canvas Y → Three.js Z. Y is up.
- `getO()` returns `{ox, oy}` — pixel origin of the room on the canvas
- `getPPM()` — pixels per meter (including zoom)

## Room Shapes
- `state.roomMode = 'free'` (freehand, default) or `'rect'` (rectangle for testing)
- Freehand: points in `state.poly[]`, closed when `state.polyDone = true`
- `nearestWall(x, y)` → `{dist, wallX, wallY, nx, ny}` — works in both modes
- Inward normals: point into the room from the wall

## Containers and Signs
- Container snaps to wall during drag (`snapToWall`). Snap is edge-based: fires when the item's edge is within 0.25m of the wall (`SNAP_DIST = Math.max(hw, hd) + 0.25`). Not a fixed 0.5m threshold.
- On mouseup: `checkAutoSkilt(container)` → automatically adds a sorting sign if within 0.8m of a wall
- Sign size scales with container width: ~70% of bin width, clamped 0.25–0.65m
- Signs store `_wallNx/Ny/X/Y` for 3D placement
- Signs follow their container during drag (`_linkedTo: container.id`)

## State (important fields)
```js
state.view            // '2d' | '3d'
state.tool            // 'move' | etc.
state.roomMode        // 'free' | 'rect'
state.poly            // [{x,y}] — room corners in meters
state.polyDone        // true when room is closed
state.polyDraw        // true while drawing
state.items           // all objects: container | wall | skilt | note | exit
state.sel             // id of selected object
state.drag            // object being dragged (null if none)
state.rotat           // object being rotated (null if none)
state.pendingSkilt    // {id, def} — sign waiting for a container click
state.zoom / panX/Y   // camera
state.sketchId        // null or backend sketch ID
state.sketchName      // display name ('Ny skisse' default)
state.customer        // customer name for PDF
state.rooms           // [{id, name, data}] — multi-room array
state.activeRoom      // index into state.rooms
state._pdfExporting   // true only during PDF snapshot — suppresses UI overlays
```

## External Resources
All Cloudflare R2 assets are served through the local `/r2/<filename>` proxy in `app.py` — never fetched directly from R2 by the browser. This avoids CORS issues and keeps `canvas.toDataURL()` usable for PDF export.

- **R2 base:** `https://pub-27fd45166dba4be8a488b48df57742df.r2.dev/`
- **GLB models (bins):** 140L.glb, 240.glb, 360.glb, 660L.glb, 1000L.glb, Balex.glb
- **GLB models (machines):** Orwak_Multi_5070.glb, OW5070_combi_restavfall.glb, EnviroPac-Kjøler.glb, APS_800.glb
- **Sorting sign PNGs (sortere.no):** loaded via same `/r2/` proxy — filenames defined in `SKILT_DEFS` in `data.js`

## Known Ongoing Issues
- No touch support for 3D orbit
- `overlayFraksjonIcons()` is written but currently disabled in `generatePDF()` — coordinate mapping from 3D scene to top-down image pixels is not yet verified (comment in app.js line ~1434)

## Decision Log

> **Rule:** Add a new entry here whenever a significant architectural decision is made, a bug fix changes how a core system works, or a pattern is established that future code must follow.
> Format: Problem → Decision → Why → Pattern to follow.

---

### 3D rebuilt on mouseup, not per frame — 2025
**Problem:** Rebuilding Three.js meshes on every mousemove event caused garbage collection and noticeable lag.
**Decision:** 2D canvas handles real-time drag feedback. The 3D scene is fully rebuilt only on `mouseup`.
**Why:** Mesh teardown + rebuild is expensive. 2D is cheap to redraw per frame. The split gives responsive drag without 3D overhead.
**Pattern:** Never call `rebuild3D()` inside `mousemove` handlers. Only on `mouseup` or explicit user action.

---

### Wall geometry pushed outward — 2025-02 (commit 0b07aec)
**Problem:** Containers placed against the wall were clipping through it in 3D.
**Decision:** Wall mesh is offset outward by half the wall thickness so containers placed at the wall edge sit flush.
**Why:** Three.js geometry is centered on its position. Without the offset, half the wall would stick into the room and half outside.
**Pattern:** Wall mesh offset must match the container snap threshold (0.5m). If the threshold changes, update the offset accordingly.

---

### PDF export: 2D snapshot + optional 3D top-down capture — 2025-03 (commit 84ee214), updated 2026-03
**Problem:** WebGL readback for a 3D snapshot is unreliable across browsers and requires significant setup.
**Decision:** PDF primary layout uses a clean 2D canvas snapshot (no UI chrome), with auto-fit scaling and a grouped data table. A top-down 3D capture (`scene3d.captureTopDown()`) is also taken and included as a visual supplement.
**Why:** The 2D canvas is the authoritative source for room data. 3D capture is visual only — the quote data always comes from `state`.
**Pattern:** PDF data (container list, dimensions, quantities) must always come from `state`. The 3D scene may be used for visual snapshots only. `scene3d.init()` is idempotent and falls back to 1200×800 if the 3D container is hidden when PDF is triggered from 2D mode. `scene3d.rebuildSync()` guarantees the scene is current before capture.

---

### HiDPI/Retina canvas scaling — 2025-01 (commit 57e6519)
**Problem:** Canvas drawing was blurry on Retina and HiDPI screens.
**Decision:** Canvas `width`/`height` are multiplied by `devicePixelRatio`. CSS size stays unchanged. All canvas content is scaled by DPR in render functions.
**Why:** Without DPR correction, the browser stretches a low-resolution canvas to fill the screen.
**Pattern:** All new `<canvas>` elements must apply DPR scaling at init. See `render2d.js` for the reference implementation.

---

### Auto-signs linked to container via `_linkedTo` — 2025
**Problem:** Sorting signs needed to move with their associated container during drag.
**Decision:** Signs store `_linkedTo: container.id`. During container drag, all items with a matching `_linkedTo` are repositioned.
**Why:** Simple reference rather than a complex parent/child tree structure. Appropriate for the scale of this project.
**Pattern:** Any item that should "follow" another uses the `_linkedTo` pattern. The drag logic in `app.js` handles this automatically.

---

### Sign offset breaks when wall geometry changes — 2026-03 (wall fix 0b07aec, sign fix follows)
**Problem:** After pushing wall meshes outward by `WALL_THICK/2` so inner faces align with the polygon boundary, signs started floating inside/over containers instead of sitting on the wall.
**Root cause:** `buildSkilt3D` used `wallThick = WALL_THICK/2 + 0.025m`. The `WALL_THICK/2` component assumed `wi.wx/wz` (from `nearestWall()`) was the wall mesh center. After the wall-push fix it became the inner face, so the sign was pushed 0.06m too far into the room — into the container mesh.
**Decision:** Remove `WALL_THICK/2` from the offset. `wallThick = frame_half_depth + clearance = 0.025m` only.
**Pattern:** `nearestWall()` always returns a point on the polygon boundary. After commit 0b07aec, polygon boundary = inner wall face. Any code offsetting from `_wallX/_wallY` must NOT add `WALL_THICK/2` — that was only needed when the wall center was at the polygon boundary.

---

### Multi-room support via rooms[] array — 2026
**Problem:** Users needed to plan multiple waste rooms in the same sketch.
**Decision:** `state.rooms[]` holds `{id, name, data}` entries. `state.activeRoom` is the index of the currently displayed room. Switching rooms serialises the current room to `data` and deserialises the target room.
**Why:** Minimal change to the existing single-room state shape — `toJSON/fromJSON` still works per-room. The outer sketch format bumped to `version: 2` to distinguish multi-room saves from legacy single-room saves.
**Pattern:** Always read/write the active room through `toJSON/fromJSON`. Never access `state.rooms[n].data` directly to get geometry — call `fromJSON` first.

---

### PostgreSQL replaces SQLite — 2026
**Problem:** SQLite on Render free tier uses ephemeral disk storage — all data is lost on every deploy or instance restart. Free PostgreSQL tier also expires after 90 days.
**Decision:** Migrated to Render paid PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL` env var). All SQL uses `%s` placeholders (psycopg2) and explicit cursor objects — `con.execute()` is not valid in psycopg2. `init_db()` uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` so it is safe to re-run on an existing database.
**Why:** Persistent storage is a hard requirement for a production sales tool. SQLite ephemeral disk means every Render deploy wipes all saved sketches.
**Pattern:** Never use `con.execute()` — always `cur = con.cursor(); cur.execute(...); con.commit(); cur.close(); con.close()`.

---

### Share-code feature — 2026
**Problem:** Sellers need to share a read-only view of a sketch with customers or colleagues without requiring an API key or account.
**Decision:** A 6-char uppercase alphanumeric code is generated on demand (POST `/api/sketches/{id}/share`, requires API key) and stored in the `share_code` column. The public read endpoint (`GET /public/{code}`, no auth) returns the sketch data. The frontend enforces read-only mode via `state.readOnly = true` + `applyReadOnly()`, which hides all edit UI and adds a fixed banner. The `onMD()` handler returns early if `state.readOnly`, so no drag/edit is possible even via keyboard or mouse.
**Why:** Backend enforcement would require a separate auth system. Frontend-only enforcement is sufficient here since the public endpoint only exposes the data — it cannot write. Customers see a clean view; sellers use the same app with full edit access.
**Pattern:** The `/public/{code}` endpoint is intentionally outside `/api/` (no auth middleware). Read-only mode must be set via `state.readOnly = true` before calling `applyReadOnly()` — the banner and hidden UI are permanent for the session.

---

### Thumbnail JPEG instead of PNG — 2026
**Problem:** `canvas.toDataURL('image/png', 0.4)` ignores the quality parameter — PNG is always lossless, making thumbnails 200–500 KB each (base64), which fills PostgreSQL 1 GB storage quickly.
**Decision:** Changed to `canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.4)` — JPEG with 40% quality reduces thumbnails to ~20–50 KB each (~10× smaller).
**Why:** 1 GB PostgreSQL storage supports ~2,000 sketches at 500 KB/thumbnail (PNG) but ~20,000+ at 50 KB/thumbnail (JPEG). JPEG thumbnails are display-only and do not need to be lossless.
**Pattern:** Always use `image/jpeg` with a quality parameter for thumbnails. The quality parameter is silently ignored for PNG.

---

### All R2 assets proxied via /r2/ — 2026
**Problem:** Direct browser fetches from Cloudflare R2 trigger CORS errors, and taint the canvas making `toDataURL()` fail during PDF export.
**Decision:** `app.py` exposes `/r2/<filename>` which fetches from R2 server-side and streams the result to the browser. All GLBs and sign PNGs go through this proxy.
**Why:** Same-origin responses are never tainted. The proxy also caches responses in-memory (up to 200 entries) to avoid redundant R2 round-trips.
**Pattern:** Never add a hard-coded `https://pub-27fd45166dba4be8a488b48df57742df.r2.dev/` URL in frontend code. Always use `/r2/<filename>`.

---

### API key auth on all /api/ routes — 2025-01 (commit 087b680)
**Problem:** The backend was open without authentication.
**Decision:** Simple API key header check (`X-API-Key`) on all `/api/` endpoints via a FastAPI dependency.
**Why:** Simple and sufficient for internal use. Avoids the complexity of OAuth/JWT for this use case.
**Pattern:** All new API routes must go under `/api/` and will inherit the auth middleware automatically.

## AI Role and Workflow
- Act as an experienced architect and senior developer.
- Write production-quality code appropriate to the project's scale — do not over-engineer.
- Avoid temporary solutions and shortcuts where they create technical debt.
- Code must be modular and easy to test.
- Always explain the performance characteristics of proposed solutions.
- State potential drawbacks of technical choices.
- Update this document when architecture or file structure changes (especially File Structure, Known Ongoing Issues, and Decision Log).
- Comment non-obvious decisions in code — explain *why*, not what. Include performance rationale (e.g. "2D only here — 3D rebuilds on mouseup to avoid per-frame mesh teardown"). Future engineers (and Claude) must be able to understand the reasoning without reading git history.
